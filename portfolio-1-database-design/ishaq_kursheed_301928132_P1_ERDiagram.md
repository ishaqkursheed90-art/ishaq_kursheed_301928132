    guest ||--o{ reservation : "guest_id"
    room ||--o{ reservation : "room_id"
```

PK identifies a record; FK links to another table; UK marks a single-field unique value. The relationship ends show exactly one, zero or one, or zero or many records. Composite unique keys and conditional rules are listed in the schema and design.
